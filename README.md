Created a React App using an API, used two different tutorials including:
https://teamtreehouse.com/ & https://medium.freecodecamp.com/surge-vs-github-pages-deploying-a-create-react-app-project-c0ecbf317089 in order for me to publish to git-pages!

Some of the code is commented specifically on the main js being App.js, GifList.js, and SearchForm.js
